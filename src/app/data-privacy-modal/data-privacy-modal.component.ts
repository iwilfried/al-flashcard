    A ​flashcard​ or ​flash card​ is a card bearing ​information​ on both sides, which is intended to be used as an aid in
    memorization​. Each flashcard bears a question on one side and an answer on the other. Flashcards are often
    used to memorize ​vocabulary​, historical dates, formulas or any subject matter that can be learned via a
    question-and-answer format. Flashcards can be virtual (part of a ​flashcard software​), or physical.
    Flashcards are an application of the ​testing effect​ − the finding that ​long-term memory​ is increased when some
    of the learning period is devoted to retrieving the information through testing with proper feedback. Study habits
    affect the rate at which a flashcard-user learns, and proper ​spacing of flashcards​ has been proven to accelerate
    learning
